## ABOUT ME.

I’m a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, and Power BI, and a growing focus on business and project-oriented analytics. My journey into data began after studying Biochemistry, where I developed an analytical mindset that now shapes how I solve data problems.

I specialize in:
- 📊 Cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
- 📈 Uncovering insights that improve sales tracking, customer behaviour, and performance measurement
  
What sets me apart:
- I ask the right questions, not just any questions
- I understand business context, not just data
- I communicate insights clearly, not just present charts
- I translate numbers into decisions people can act on

Beyond analytics, I actively build projects, pursue certifications, and contribute to a learning community helping aspiring analysts gain real-world skills.
I’m particularly interested in roles where data, business strategy, and execution intersect — where insights don’t just live in dashboards, but drive action.
