## ABOUT ME.

I’m a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, and Power BI, and a growing focus on business and project-oriented analytics. My journey into data began after studying Biochemistry, where I developed an analytical mindset that now shapes how I solve data problems.

I specialize in:
- 📊 Cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
- 📈 Uncovering insights that improve sales tracking, customer behaviour, and performance measurement
  
What sets me apart:
- I ask the right questions, not just any questions
- I understand business context, not just data
- I communicate insights clearly, not just present charts
- I translate numbers into decisions people can act on
